;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a collection of tools for writing verified programs in
;; languages of the Boogie family. Dafny and Boogie are the two currently
;; supported languages. Features include:
;;
;; * Syntax highlighting
;; * Real-time compilation (using flycheck)
;; * Completion (using company)
;; * Code folding (using hideshow)
;; * Prettification (using prettify-symbols-mode)
;;
;; In addition, the Dafny mode offers:
;; * (A few) Snippets (using yasnippet)
;; * (Some) In-Emacs documentation (using shr)
;; * (Experimental) Navigation between Dafny and Boogie source files
;; * (Some support for) indentation
;; * (Some support for) jumping to a definition
;;
;; See https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie-friends/ for a full description. The
;; documentation that accompanies certain snippets in dafny-mode was not written
;; as part of this package; it is automatically generated from Dafny's quick
;; reference guide.

;;; Code:

;; This file is a collection of convenient definitions and utilies for the
;; various programming modes that this package offers.
