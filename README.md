# Boogie friends

A collection of tools for interacting with Boogie and related languages.

## Emacs package (`boogie-mode`, `dafny-mode`)

The `boogie-friends` package is an experimental collection of Emacs modes for
writing verified programs in languages of the Boogie family. Dafny and Boogie
are the two currently supported languages. Features include:

* Syntax highlighting
* Real-time compilation (using `flycheck`)
* Completion (using `company`)
* Code folding (using `hideshow`)
* Prettification (using `prettify-symbols-mode`)

In addition, the Dafny mode offers:

* (A few) Snippets (using `yasnippet`)
* (Some) In-Emacs documentation
* (Experimental) Navigation between Dafny and Boogie source files
* (Some support for) indentation
* (Some support for) jumping to a definition

### Some pictures:

Notice the error highlighting, the symbol beautification (`forall` appears as `âˆ€`), and the code folding on the last line!

(require 'dafny-mode)
(require 'boogie-mode)

(defun setup-boogie-friends ()
  (setq flycheck-dafny-executable "PATH-TO-DAFNY")
